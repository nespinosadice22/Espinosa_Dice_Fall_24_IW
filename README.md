# Espinosa_Dice_Fall_24_IW

This repository contains all of the code and data for my Fall '24 IW project, Predicting Future Drug Trafficking Hotspots in Colombia. It is divided into three folders: 

1) Raw Data: Contains all raw data sorted by database

2) Models: Contains a notebook entitled "Final Models" that show the final code and results included in the final report, as well as a folder entitled "Week to Week Progression," which contains the code written each week, admittedly in a less organized fashion.
  
4) Data Processing: Most important is the "Final Data 12/5" folder, which includes the final processed data in csv form. However, the other folders contain intermediate steps of processed/collected data from various weeks along the way.
